A data science project aimed at understanding traffic congestions in terms of duration and its anomalies primarily in WA state, but scalable.

The project is twofold: a regression model to predict the duration of congestion if it happens, leading into a anomaly detector to see if early intervention is necessary.

The app developed for this project is not deployed due to cost concerns, you can find the app in "TrafficApp" folder.
